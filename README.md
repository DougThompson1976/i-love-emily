Emily Howell is a computer program, created by the classical composer [David Cope][cope], that composes original music of surprising artistic quality. [Examples of her work][emily] can be found on [Cope's Youtube channel][davidhcope].

The goal of this project is to reimplement parts of this program in Haskell, in order to better understand its inner workings and creative algorithms. David Cope has kindly documented his work on algorithmic composition in many books and source code files, including

* [*Computer Models of Musical Creativity*.][cmmc] Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. 2006
* [Source code][cmmc-code] for *Computer Models of Musical Creativity*. Written in [Macintosh Common Lisp.][mac-clisp]
